        <p>Rather than forcing you to revise your mixing method, the FaderPort 8
          augments the way you currently mix. You still use your faithful keyboard
          and mouse for things they do well, and the FaderPort 8 handles the
          features you want to get your fingers on, allowing you to customize your
          workflow. <br>
          Reasonus is build with the reknown forces of CSI. A comprehensive and actively maintained tool with a large
          active community. This is also the reason you’re able to knead ReaSonus to your needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is DAW control the way you always hoped it could be!
